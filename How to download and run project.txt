Instructions for downloading and opening project in android studio:

There's probably other ways, but this is the way that has worked for me.

1.  Start a new project in Android Studio and download anything required, make sure the project opens and runs with no errors
2.  Download project from github
3.  Copy the main file from the exisiting downloaded files
4.  Find the main file in the android studio project you opened previously
	(for me it was found in C:\Users\Owner\AndroidStudioProjects\*whatever you named the project*\app\src\main)
5.  Replace the main folder with the downloaded main folder
6.  Open the android studio project again and pray everythings there, build/run the project and hope that there are no errors

7.  Don't forget to check that all the build.gradle Dependencies are there, they are not included in the main folder
