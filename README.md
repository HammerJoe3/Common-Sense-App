Common Sense Application

  Purpose of the Application
  
The application is used to promote Common Sense, a persistent antimicrobial solution. Users will be required to create a login so that their name, address, location, etc. may be stored. The app will contain features that users of Common Sense will be interested in.  Access to important health information in the form of news from the CDC and FDA will help keep users up to date and safe. It will also allow users to view their local weather and what effects it could have on their health. The app can be used to find where the product is sold and where it has been used to treat a location. A store is available to users would prefer to order the product through the application.
